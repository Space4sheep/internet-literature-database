# internet-literature-database
The main idea behind this web application was to create a convenient system for
bookkeeping. However, as the code was being written, new and new ideas appeared, and
now it has grown into a concept of a social network for book lovers.

Currently implemented features include:
- Registration/authentication system
- Ability to create, edit, and delete bookshelves (an abstraction that functions as categories for sorting)
- Books ratings
- Ability to leave reviews
- Database of 20,000 books (including title, author, genre, cover image, and description)
- Search functionality for the database
- User can add books toprofile that are included in the top lists mentioned in the articles.
